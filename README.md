# Breedog-WebApp
Web application based on a database for dog breeders.
Breedog allows dog breeders to register and access to their personal page that contains all the informations that can be updated. There is a specific dog list page that shows all the dogs that a specific breeder owns and is possible to add new dogs.
Each dog has a lot of info like name, description, phisical measures, microchip code, competitions in which take part in, father, mother, sons, etc... All these information can be updated only by the owner of the dog.
The front-end is created by scratch using HTML5, CSS, JS and Bootstrap.
The back-end is based on Java Servlet.
The original version was developed on a private Bitbucket repo, this is a cloned one.
